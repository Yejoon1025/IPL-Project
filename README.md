Intuitive Programming Language Project

In this project, we seek to create a more intuitive programming language (and compiler) built around the idea that coding is another method of the reification of thought.

Goal: Create a more intuitive programming language

Checkpoint 1: Create (up to) the compiler
  A. Design the language
    1. Make a simpler basis for the language that works just with sentences
    2. Incorporate context/ pragrmatics into this language.
  B. Create a compiler for the language
Checkpoint 2: Create a GUI or IDE
